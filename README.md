# GILA Test
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The branch develop is the most updated, check the new stuff there.

I also added a linter, XO, which is my personal favorite
https://github.com/xojs/xo

And prettier, but I had to disable it due to compatibility issues, the ones will likely take me more time to fix than to just disable the thing
https://github.com/prettier/prettier
So nop prettier for the moment. 

Install the required dependencies with npm install


What I tried to do here is to use different concepts from react.
Yes, the end product might look like it doesn't have start nor beginning, but I wanted to display that I know the concepts. 
I was planning to use context for the header, but time and my job got in the way
