# GILA Test
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The branch develop is the most updated, check the new stuff there.

I also added a linter, XO, which is my personal favorite
https://github.com/xojs/xo

And prettier, but I had to disable it due to compatibility issues, the ones will likely take me more time to fix than to just disable the thing
https://github.com/prettier/prettier
So nop prettier for the moment. 

Install the required dependencies with npm install
